# ðŸ§  Random Agent vs Smart Agent

This project compares the performance of a **Random Agent** and a **Smart Agent** in a defined environment, demonstrating the effectiveness of strategic decision-making over random behavior in AI systems.


## ðŸ¤– Agents Description

### Random Agent
- Makes decisions by choosing actions at random.
- No learning or strategy involved.
- Serves as a baseline for performance comparison.

### Smart Agent
- Uses a deterministic or learning-based approach (e.g., rule-based logic, reinforcement learning, or heuristic strategies).
- Aims to maximize performance through intelligent decision-making.

## ðŸ§ª Environment

- Define your custom environment or use a standard one (e.g., GridWorld, Tic-Tac-Toe, OpenAI Gym environment).
- Both agents interact with the same environment under identical conditions.

## ðŸ“Š Evaluation

- Performance metrics may include:
  - Win rate
  - Average reward
  - Number of steps taken to reach goal
  - Time taken per episode

### Example Output

| Agent        | Win Rate | Avg. Reward | Avg. Steps |
|--------------|----------|-------------|------------|
| Random Agent | 20%      |  -15.2      | 78         |
| Smart Agent  | 85%      |  +9.8       | 32         |
